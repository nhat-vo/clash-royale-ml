Objectives:\n### a. Clash Royale:\nClash Royale is a realtime strategy mobile game, where 2 players fight over a 3-minute match to destroy their opponent's towers. Each player will have a prechosen deck consisting of 8 cards, and will continuously deploy their cards which are either minions or spells. The game ends after 3 minutes, or if a player's main tower is destroyed.\n\nAs simple as it may sound, analyzing who would win a match is very difficult, due to the huge permutations of cards (there are 106 cards in total), as well as the different players' skills. In this notebook, we are going to analyze the dataset with the following assumptions:\n- The matches happen in a small time span (December 2021), and no update (tweaks to each card's stats) are done.\n- The matches happen between the top-ranked players in the world, and they all have very similar skills.\n\n### b. Our approach:\nIn this notebook, we are going to try and see whether we can predict an outcome of a match using the decks and the rank of each player.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\n# for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n#     for filename in filenames:\n#         print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\nimport json\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T13:00:16.977804Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T13:00:16.978456Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T13:00:17.007514Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-22T13:00:16.97836Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T13:00:17.006534Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cards = pd.read_json('/kaggle/input/clash-royale-dataset/data/cards.json')\ncards.drop(columns=['arena', 'description'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T13:01:25.318903Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T13:01:25.319233Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T13:01:25.349344Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-22T13:01:25.319199Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T13:01:25.348762Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cards['type'].unique()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T10:14:18.928207Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T10:14:18.928508Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T10:14:18.936496Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-22T10:14:18.928476Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T10:14:18.935484Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"with open('/kaggle/input/clash-royale-dataset/data/cards_stats.json') as file:\n    cards_stats = json.load(file)\nfor i in cards_stats['troop']:\n    if i['key'] == 'barbarian-barrel':\n        print(i)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T13:01:29.365725Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T13:01:29.36634Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T13:01:29.421489Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-22T13:01:29.366301Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T13:01:29.420815Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cards_stats","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T13:01:38.987047Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T13:01:38.987843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T13:01:41.004814Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-22T13:01:38.9878Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T13:01:40.99271Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.
